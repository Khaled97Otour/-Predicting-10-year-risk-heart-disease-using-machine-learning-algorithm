# -Predicting-10-year-risk-heart-disease-using-machine-learning-algorithm

In this project, I use data from kaggle.com to study the heart disease :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression
this data contain the following:

1. male
2. age
3. education
4. currentSmoker
5. cigsPerDay
6. BPMeds
7. prevalentStroke
8. prevalentHyp
9. diabetes
10. totChol
11. sysBP
12. diaBP
13. BMI
14. heartRate
15. glucose

# building the model:
For classification first I will build a normail logictic model and study the results.
. I used diffrent types of classification models (KNN, Decision Tree and random forest) and the results  were the following:

1. All KNN , Decision Tree and random Forest shows low F1 and recall scores.
2. Logictic classification give us the best results.
3. One of the down side is the unbalance of our dataset.
4 .The large number of our features are one of the reason of overfitting (complexity).
